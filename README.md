🚀 Loan Data Insights & Visualization 📊

I recently worked on an in-depth analysis of loan data, leveraging data visualization to uncover key insights into lending trends. Using interactive charts and maps, I explored:

📈 Monthly Trends: Identifying seasonality & long-term lending patterns.
🗺 Regional Analysis: Mapping significant lending activities across states.
🎯 Loan Term Distribution: Understanding how loans vary across different term lengths.
👨‍💼 Employment & Lending: Assessing how employment length influences loan applications.
🏡 Home Ownership Impact: Exploring its role in loan disbursements.
💳 Loan Purpose Breakdown: Analyzing why borrowers seek financing.

This project provided data-driven insights to optimize lending strategies and enhance decision-making. Excited to continue working on similar data analytics & visualization challenges!
